VME LED Driver library

* How to use
- For use with JLab compiled gefvme kernel driver.

** =jvme=
- install the jvme library
  https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jvme.git
  
** compilation
- with the environment defined from the jvme install (=LINUXVME_LIB=, =LINUXVME_INC=) build and install the library
  #+begin_src shell
make install
  #+end_src

** test program
- In the test directory, there's a program to show the status of a VLD at a specified slot
- compile with
  #+begin_src shell
    cd test
    make
  #+end_src
- execute
  #+begin_src shell
    ./vldStatus <slotnumber>
  #+end_src

** William's examples
- The examples =VLDtest5=, =VLDtest6=, =VLDtest7=, cited in the VLD Manual, were ported for use with this library
  - =VLDtest5=: VLD calibration pulse shape loading
  - =VLDtest6=: VLD test, channel by channel calibration, and connector by connector Bleaching test
  - =VLDtest7=: VLD clock source switching and trigger source switching
- compile with
  #+begin_src shell
    cd examples
    make
  #+end_src
- execute with
  #+begin_src shell
    ./VLDtest5 <slotnumber>
    ./VLDtest6 <slotnumber>
    ./VLDtest7 <slotnumber>
  #+end_src

** firmware update
- The =VLDtest2=: VLD firmware update, was ported for use with this library.
- compile with
  #+begin_src shell
    cd firmware
    make
  #+end_src
- execute with
  #+begin_src shell
    ./vldFirmwareUpdate <slotnumber> <firmware svf file>
  #+end_src
